If you’ve ever worked with \*\*substation automation systems\*\*, you already know this truth: testing and

integration can be a headache.



Every time you need to validate an \*\*IEC 61850\*\* setup, you’re chasing hardware IEDs, juggling SCL files,

waiting for network configurations, and praying your test environment behaves like the real one.



At \*\*Deliverain\*\*, we kept running into this same pain — over and over again.  

So, we decided to do something about it.

\## ⚡ Why We Built It



We wanted to give engineers, testers, and integrators a way to bring \*\*substation automation into

the lab\*\* — without relying on hardware, without complex setups, and without losing the realism of

an actual IEC 61850 network.



Our goal was simple:



> “Make it easy to simulate, visualize, and validate substation communication — anytime, anywhere.”



So we started building our own \*\*IEC 61850 Simulator\*\*, powered by the open-source \*\*libIEC61850\*\*

stack, and then extended it far beyond basic simulation.

\## 🧩 What the Simulator Does



Our simulator emulates the behavior of real \*\*Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)\*\* — the same devices

used in modern substations — and lets you interact with them through familiar tools and protocols.



Here’s what’s inside:



\### 📂 SCL File Support

Just load your \*\*SCD\*\*, \*\*ICD\*\*, or \*\*CID\*\* file — the simulator automatically parses and builds the IED data

model for you.  

No manual setup. No copy-paste errors.



\### 🧠 Model Viewer

Visualize your logical nodes, data objects, and attributes through an intuitive tree view.  

It’s like opening up an IED and seeing how it thinks.



\### 🔄 Multi-IED Simulation

Need to simulate multiple IEDs talking to each other? Done.  

Each IED runs as an independent instance, complete with its own configuration and data model.

This simulator helps \*\*bring substation automation to the lab\*\* — enabling engineers to test, visualize, and validate

IEC 61850 communication efficiently and realistically.



Stay tuned for upcoming posts where we’ll explore:

\- Integrating with \*\*OPC DA / UA\*\* for data interoperability  

\- Extending simulation to cover \*\*GOOSE\*\* and \*\*MMS\*\* messaging  

\- Visual dashboards for IED performance insights
